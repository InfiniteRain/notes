# Notes

This project was made for the Java Technologies course (ICS0014) as the final project assignment. Author: David
LÃµssenko.

This is a simple application that lets the user keep track of their notes. The user can add new notes, delete existing
notes and modify existing notes. The notes are saved in a JSON file on application termination, and loaded on
application initialization. The application makes use of JavaFX library, by loading stages from the `.fxml` files.

This project uses Maven dependency `org.json` for parsing JSON files. So, before running it, make sure that every
dependency is installed. The main class of this project is `NotesApp`.
